This script can pick pixel in an image from a mouse click, and the pixel value will be printed in terminal.
The environment is anaconda3 or python 3.6 and opencv 3.x.
It is worth paying attention that the opencv installed by conda is not compiled with window display function. I compile it from source code. 

the use of the scirpt:
python3 get_pixel.py aachen_000000_000019_gtFine_color.png

then am image will be displayed and if you click on image, pixel value is shown in terminal.
That's all!
